Here is one way to create an Ubuntu instance on EC2.

## Terminate your current instance

1. go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home#s=Instances
2. right click your instance
3. select `Terminate` under `Instance Lifecycle` section.

This will take a couple of minutes... (You can see log for what's exactly happening)

## Launch an Ubuntu instance

1. Go to https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2` (it should be `0 Running Instances`)
2. Click `Launch Instance`
3. select `Quick Launch Wizard` on the left hand side
 1. type a name for this instance
 2. choose a key pair (use the same on as your old instance does)
 3. select `Ubuntu Server 12.04.1 LTS` `64 bit`
4. click `Continue`
5. click `Launch`

This will take another couple of minutes... (You can see log for what's exactly happening)

Now, make sure you know:

 - how to associate an `Elastic IP address` to this instance
   - & the `Public DNS` of your instance
 - how to connect to this instance via SSH (the default user will be `ubuntu` instead of `root`)
 - EC2 `Security Group` stuff (open ports)
